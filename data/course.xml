    <intro>
        This webapp is an experiment to leverage the course materials for 
        COMP4711 at BCIT, making them easier for my dayschool students to
        access, and making them more broadly accessible, for instance
        to the CodeIgniter community.<br/>
        Concurrently with my dayschool course this Winter 2015 term,
        I am running a pilot with up to four remote learners from
        around the world. The remote students will have access to the same 
        resources as the dayschool ones, and will be expected to complete
        labs and assignments. I will give them feedback and grades for their 
        work, but they will not receive academic credit for participating.<br/>
        Something I will be asking all of the students to do is, to provide
        brief feedback for each component of the course!!
