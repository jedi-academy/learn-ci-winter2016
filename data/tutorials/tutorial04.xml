    <slide title="Tutorial Goals" layout="normal">
        <p>We talked about models in class ... 
            this tutorial is meant to give you an opportunity to explore 
            and practice a bunch of what we talked about :)</p>
        <p>I have prepared a starter webapp – a mini "menu ordering system". 
            It has controllers and views, but is incomplete – lacking models, 
            which you are to provide.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Preparation" layout="normal">
        <p>I have prepared a 
            <a href="https://github.com/comp4711/winter2015-lab04">
                starter webapp</a>. The lab 4 starter, Jim's Joint, 
            is meant to handle ordering in a small restaurant. 
            I have build some database tables for this 
            (menu and then orders &amp; order items), 
            as well as some minimal controllers and views.</p>
        <p>The webapp is "broken" as delivered, and will not
            run properly until you fix it :)</p>
        <p>Fork the github project, and clone it locally to
            work with, the same as you have done with the previous tutorial.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="The End Result" layout="normal">
        <p>This is what the end result should look like, after fixing!</p>

    <slide title="Database Setup" layout="normal">
        <p>You will need to setup your webapp's database, using the 
            supplied script, <code>data/comp4711-lab04-setup.sql</code>.
            Please name the database "comp4711", so that your webapp will
            work without additional setup when I run it on my system.</p>
        <p>As part of the tutorial, you will then build models for each 
            of the tables contained in it. </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Database Design" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The RDB data provided is a pretty standard associative entity, 
                very much like the diagram to the right. In our case,
                OrderItems is the associative entity/table connecting Menu and Orders.</p>
            <p>In an O-O world, an ideal implementation would have an Order class, 
                which had a collection of OrderItem objects as one of its 
                properties. If we did that, the focus would end up more on good
                O-O practices rather than how you work with models inside a 
                framework. The approach that I ended up taking is simple, 
                but defensible.</p>

    <slide title="Model Implementation" layout="normal">
        <p>You can use the database and active record classes built into 
            CodeIgniter to complete this (using the CodeIgniter user guide 
            for details), or you can build on the starter models in 
            <code>core/MY_Model</code>. The former approach will get you deeper 
            into the CodeIgniter "way", but the latter approach is the easier one.</p> 
        <p>The base model supplied with the starter app provides
            for single key tables (MY_Model) as well as composite key
            tables (MY_Model2).</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Controller Expectations" layout="normal">
        <p>There are two controllers: Welcome and Order. 
            The welcome page displays a summary of the orders handled so far, 
            with a link to the order page to deal with order handling. 
            Methods are provided in the Order controller to create a new order, 
            to add an item to an order, and to "checkout". 
            The checkout prompts for confirmation and takes the user back to 
            the homepage if appropriate.</p>
        <p>Each of the controller methods has comments and pseudo-code 
            sufficient to guide you in the intended use of the model 
            classes you need to build.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="What Needs Fixing?" layout="normal">
        <p>There are seven steps to complete, the way I have broken
            the problem down. Each is described on following slides.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Configuration</li>
            <li>Homepage</li>
            <li>Handle a new order</li>
            <li>Handle order display</li>
            <li>Handle order additions</li>
            <li>Handle checkout</li>
            <li>Handle completion</li>
        </ol>
    </slide>

    <slide title="1. CONFIGURATION" layout="normal">
        <p>Fix the <code>config/autoload</code> and <code>config/database</code> 
            files.</p>
        <p>
            <code>config/autoload.php</code> needs to load the database library. 
            You can also load your three models here, or you can load 
            them in the constructors of any controllers that need them.</p>
        <p>
            <code>config/database.php</code> needs to reference the appropriate 
            database name, and MySQL username/password to work with them. 
            If you are using this at home, or elsewhere, with a different 
            username/password, then add a configuration subfolder with
            your settings, and "git ignore" it so it is not part of
            your repository. That would technically make your config
            <code>config/development/database.php</code>
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="2. HOMEPAGE" layout="normal">
        <p>Fix the default controller. It needs to get completed 
            order data from somewhere.</p>
        <p>
            <code>controllers/Welcome.php</code> ... 
            the loop at line 31 expects a variable <code>$completed</code> 
            to contain the order data, as an associative array. 
            Completed orders can be distinguished by their 
            status being 'c'. </p>
        <p>Put this together, 
            and the "fix" is to assign <code>$this->orders->some('status','c')</code>
            to <code>$completed</code>, if you are using the provided
            base models. 
            I determined this by inspecting the <code>Active_record</code> 
            interface at the top of <code>core/MY_Model.php</code>.
        </p>   
    </slide>

    <slide title="3. HANDLE A NEW ORDER" layout="normal">
        <p>You need to fix <code>controllers/Order::neworder()</code>, 
            creating a new order record with an order number one higher than the 
            last used.</p>
        <p>
            <code>Active_record::highest()</code> returns the highest key 
            used in a model/table.<br/>
            <code>$this-&gt;orders-&gt;highest()</code> gives the last order # used.<br/>
            I suggest setting <code>$order_num</code> to that plus 1.</p>
        <p>
            <code>Active_record::create()</code> creates a new record.<br/>
            <code>$this-&gt;orders-&gt;create()</code> hence creates a new object, 
            with all the fields from the Orders table, 
            initialized to blank.<br/>
            Set the order properties properly (number, current date, status), 
            then save the new order object (add it to the orders model).
        </p>   
    </slide>

    <slide title="4. HANDLE ORDER DISPLAY" layout="normal">
        <p>There are two pieces here – building the title for the page (order # 
            and total), and building the graphical menu display.</p>
        <p>Fix <code>controllers/order:display_menu()</code>. 
            It needs to get order data from somewhere.
            It also needs to get the column data from somewhere.</p>
        <p>You are given the order # as a parameter.
            Retrieve the order record from the orders table, for instance 
            <code>$order = $this-&gt;orders-&gt;get($order_num)</code>.
            A starting point for the title would then be <code>$order-&gt;num</code> or <code>$order_num</code>.
            This is the first part of the FIXME at line 32.</p>   
    </slide>

    <slide title="Order Display - Column Data" layout="normal">
        <p>Inspecting <code>views/show_menu</code>, the data for each column 
            comes from an array of Menu records. 
            The <code>make_column</code> method in <code>controllers/Order</code> 
            looks ready for that, and it is even passed the value of the 
            category to use for relevant menu items.</p>
        <p>Sounds like the body of that method (FIXME on line 44) 
            will be very similar to the fix we applied to the Welcome controller... 
            <code>return $this-&gt;menu-&gt;some('category',$category)</code>
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Order Display - Order Total" layout="normal">
        <p>Fix <code>models/Orders::total()</code>. 
            It needs to calculate the current total of an order.
            It will need to get all of the items that make up that order.</p>
        <p>The last part of the menu display is showing the order total in the title.
            The <code>models/Orders::total()</code> method (lines 20+) is 
            meant to handle that.
            In order to calculate the total for an order, 
            iterate over the items in an order. 
            For each, retrieve its corresponding menu item. 
            Add the orderitem quantity times the menu price to the order total.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Order Model Needs Updating Too" layout="normal">
        <p>The order total is also a property in the orders table. 
            The writeup says it only has to be saved/accurate when an order 
            is completed. You could make a design decision to update the order 
            total whenever an item was added to an order, 
            in which case this step could be satisfied by getting 
            that property from the order. Regardless of your design decision, 
            you will need to complete the <code>Order::total()</code> 
            method at some point.</p>
        <p>However you calculate or get the order total, it needs to be 
            appended to the page title, inside parentheses. 
            It would be a good idea to format it nicely and consistently. 
            Any of the <code>money_format</code>, <code>number_format</code> 
            or <code>sprintf</code> functions,
            built-in to PHP , could do the trick.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="5. HANDLE ORDER ADDITIONS" layout="normal">
        <p>Fix <code>controllers/Order:add()</code>. 
            It will need to use <code>models/Orders::add_item()</code> to do useful stuff.</p>
        <p>This method is invoked when a menu picture is clicked on. 
            You can see that by mousing over any of the menu item images 
            and observing the target link in the bottom left of your browser window.</p>
        <p>
            <code>Order::add</code> needs to properly update the <code>orderitems</code> 
            table to reflect the request.
            In theory, the logic to do this could be in a controller 
            (interpreting it as business logic), or in a 
            model (interpreting it as model logic). 
            Given the "model adapter" strategy that PHP frameworks favor, 
            it makes most sense to deal with the logic inside the model, 
            reducing the coupling between the controller and model layers.</p>   
    </slide>

    <slide title="Order Additions - Facade" layout="normal">
        <p>
            <code>Order::add(num,item)</code> then becomes just a facade for 
            calling the related model method, <code>models/Orders::add_item(...)</code>. 
            These have similar names to reinforce the connection between them.</p>
        <p>So, the controller fix (line 50 fixme) is simply 
            <code>$this-&gt;orders-&gt;add_item($order_num,$item)</code>.</p>
        <p>The add_item method in the orders model now needs to be completed.
            There, you need to see if that item is part of the order already, 
            in which case retrieve its record, 
            increment the quantity and then update the table. 
            If it isn't already there, you will need to make 
            an empty orderitem record, and populate its fields 
            appropriately (including setting the quantity to 1), 
            before adding that record to the table.</p>   
    </slide>

    <slide title="Order Additions - Orderitems?" layout="normal">
        <p>The <code>Orderitems</code> model is not referenced inside any 
            controller. I did this on purpose, hoping that you would conclude 
            that such references belong in the Orders model. 
            In the Orders model, you will need to get a handle to the CodeIgniter 
            instance, and then load the Orderitems model, because of O-O scoping. 
            Even if autoloaded, Orderitems would be a property of the controller 
            object, and out of scope inside a model object. </p>
        <p>The idea, inside <code>models/Orders</code>: 
            <code>$CI = &amp;get_instance(); $CI-&gt;load-&gt;model('orderitems');</code> 
        </p>
        <p>This will inject an <code>orderitems</code> property, inside the 
            Orders model, so that we can manipulate the orderitems table.</p>
        <p>If you made the earlier design decision to keep an order's total 
            continuously updated, then you would hav
            that method here. Otherwise, you are done.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Order Additions - Ideal Treatment?" layout="normal">
        <p>An ideal implementation would have some domain/entity classes, 
            specifically a <code>domain/Order</code> to deal with the logic here that 
            might feel awkward in a controller or in a conventional orders 
            model, which is part of the data access layer and not an entity 
            encapsulation.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, it might have been kinder to you 
            to follow this strategy, even if it meant a more complex 
            starter app – O-O cohesion could have been better.</p>   
    </slide>

    <slide title="6. HANDLE CHECKOUT" layout="normal">
        <p>Fix <code>controllers/Order::checkout()</code>. 
            Where do the order details come from?</p>
        <p>
            <code>controllers/order::check_out()</code> displays the 
            <code>show_order</code> view.
            You need to pass view parameters to this.</p>
        <p>
            <code>order_num</code> and <code>total</code> come from the 
            <code>order</code> object. You know how to get this.</p>
        <p>
            Items will be provided by the <code>Orders::details()</code> method 
            - that is its intended purpose.
            In other words,<br/>
            <code>$this-&gt;data['items'] = $this-&gt;orders-&gt;details($num);</code>
        </p>
        <p>The <code>models/Orders::details()</code> method will need to 
            access the <code>orderitems</code> model, similarly to the last step, 
            and retrieve the relevant orderitems records, 
            using the some method you have already seen.</p>   
    </slide>

    <slide title="Checkout - Order Validation" layout="normal">
        <p>Validate the order before displaying the checkout page. 
            To be considered "valid", it must include at least one 
            item from each menu category.</p>
        <p>
            <code>models/Orders</code> has a <code>validate()</code> method. 
            Implement this, and then the view parameter becomes easy ...<br/>
            <code>$this-&gt;data['okornot'] = $this-&gt;orders-&gt;validate($num);</code>
        </p>

            <code>controllers/Order::proceed()</code> needs to update the order 
            status, to 'c', and to make sure the date/time and the total are properly set too.</p>
        <p>
            <code>controllers/Order::cancel()</code> needs to update the order 
            status to 'x' (for cancelled), after deleting any related 
            orderitems records. To maintain cohesion, 
            there is a <code>flush(num)</code> method in the <code>models/Orders</code> 
            class, for you to implement. 
            It needs to retrieve the orderitems for an order, and then delete them. 
            The controller <code>cancel()</code> method would then call this model method.</p>

        <p>Make sure the homepage displays completed orders, with correct totals!</p>
        <p>This is more of a quality control step, making sure that the 
            expected completed orders are shown :)</p>

        <p>I warned you to skim the whole slideshow before beginning!</p>
        <p>Your controllers only ever need to deal with the menu and orders models. 
            Your orders model is the only place you need to deal with the orderitems model.</p>
