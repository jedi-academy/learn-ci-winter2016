        <p>This short lesson introduces some project workflow techniques.</p>

            <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows" target="_blank">
                Atlassian</a> has some great tutorials,
            and I am using some of their images here.
        </p>
        <p>Github itself has some handy guides, on the  
            <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.htm" target="_blank">
                GitHub Flow</a>, for instance, and on

                forking projects</a>.

    <slide title="Centralized Workflow" layout="normal" tag="tag1">
        <div class="left">
            <p>With a centralized workflow, all the developers on a project
                share a central repository.</p>
            <p>They clone the repository locally, but they all publish
                changes to the shared repository.</p>

    <slide title="Branching Workflow" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Following a branching workflow means that all feature development
                takes place in dedicated branches, other than "master".</p>
            <p>Once a feature is complete, its branch would then be merged
                into the "master" branch.</p>
            <p>Fixing an issue is considered a mini-feature, and would 
                be handled in its own (short-lived) branch.</p>

    <slide title="Gitflow Workflow" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Gitflow workflow is a strict branching model convention.</p>
            <p>You have two main branches, "master" and "develop".
                The "master" branch is always release-ready, and is usually tagged
                with a release version number.</p>
            <p>All development is done on the "develop" branch, which is merged
                into the "master" branch to form a new release.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">

    </slide>

    <slide title="Forking Workflow" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>With the forking workflow, there is a main repository,
                and each developer "forks" it to make their
                own server-side repository, which is then cloned locally.</p>
            <p>Developers push code changes to their own repository,
                and trigger a pull request when they are ready to merge
                their changes into the official repository.</p>
            <p>Only the maintainer of the official repository can update it.</p>

    <slide title="Github Workflow" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <ol>
                <li>Fork a github project</li>
                <li>Clone your fork locally</li>
                <li>Create a topic branch</li>
                <li>Commit changes to your branch</li>
                <li>Push your changes to your fork</li>
                <li>Send a pull request to the original project</li>
